# MyReads Project

This is a Virtuall Bookshelf u can search for books and add it to your personal bookshelf.
There are 3 Bookshelfs Read wantToRead and currently reading.
if a book in the search page is already in one of your shelf it is marked red.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`


## Written in Javascript HTML, CSS and the React-libary

I used useEffect for handling the sideEffects like fetching data from the backend and useState for holding important data for changes.
I divided the pages in small indivudall components that can be reused
