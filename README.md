# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. If you choose to start with this template, your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to bootstrap the project.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`


## Written in Javascript and the React-libary

This is a Virtuall Bookshelf u can search for books and add it to your personal bookshelf.
There are 3 Bookshelfs Read wantToRead and currently reading.
if a book in the search page is already in one of your shelf it is marked red.

I used just useEffect for handling the sideEffects like fetching data from the backend and useState for holding important data for changes.
